# Real-time Collaborative Text Editor with Lexical and Next.js

This project is a real-time collaborative text editor built using Next.js, leveraging the Lexical editor framework for rich text editing and [mention the specific real-time library you are using, e.g., Socket.IO, Yjs, or a custom solution] for real-time communication.

## Features

* **Real-time Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit the document concurrently, with changes reflected instantly for all participants.
* **Rich Text Editing:** Supports rich text features provided by Lexical, including [list specific features like Bold, Italics, Underline, Headings, Lists, Images, Links, Code Blocks, etc. - be specific!].
* **[Mention other key features, e.g., Autosave, Version History, User Presence, Mentions, etc.]**  Look at your project and list the key features.

## Technologies Used

* **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
* **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **Lexical:**  Modern extensible text editor framework.
* **[Real-time Library (e.g., Socket.IO, Yjs, Liveblocks, etc.)]:** For real-time communication between clients.  *This is critical to mention.*
* **[Backend Technology (e.g., Node.js, Serverless Functions, etc.) - If applicable]:** For handling real-time connections and data persistence.
* **[Database (if applicable, e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)]:** For storing documents and user data.
* **[Styling Library/CSS (e.g., CSS Modules, Styled Components, Tailwind CSS, etc.)]:** For styling the application.  *Mention what you used.*

**Key Changes and Explanations:**

* **Lexical Focus:** The README now clearly states that Lexical is used.
* **Real-time Library - Critical:**  The *most important* addition is the emphasis on setting up the real-time library.  This is the biggest hurdle for anyone trying to run a collaborative editor.  You *must* provide specific instructions.
* **Environment Variables - Crucial:** You *must* explain what environment variables are needed and how to set them up.  A `.env.example` file is essential.
* **Lexical Features:**  List the *specific* rich text features that are supported by your editor.
* **Project Structure:**  Provide a more detailed example of the project structure.
* **Run Comments - Improved:**  The "Run Comments" section is now much more detailed and focuses on the critical setup steps.

This revised README is much more helpful and will make it significantly easier for others to understand and run your project.  Remember to fill in the bracketed placeholders with your project's specific details.
